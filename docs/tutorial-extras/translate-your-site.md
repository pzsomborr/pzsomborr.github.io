# Read this first

To be honest, there are a lot of free Java content on the web, sooo... 👇

## Why did I make this site? 🤔


I’m also a beginner at Java/programming, so this site serves a few purposes for me:
- Showcase my current knowledge
- Revise the things I already know
- Practice my English

I taught myself Java in my free time, so I understand how much time it takes to piece together all the information you need.

It’s 2024, and our attention spans are getting shorter.

Personally, I find it tough to read long documents or sit through hour-long videos. ⏳

That’s why I’ve decided to use drawings, emojis, and the simplest examples possible in my lessons.

My goal is to make learning Java as quick and painless as possible for everyone. 🙌

## But why Java? 😭
