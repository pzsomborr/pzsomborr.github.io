# Welcome

To be honest!, there are a lot of free Java content on the web, sooo... 👇

## Why did I make this site? 🤔


I’m also a beginner at Java/programming, so this site serves a few purposes for me:
- Showcase my current knowledge
- Revise the things I already know
- Practice my English

I taught myself Java in my free time, so I understand how much time it takes to piece together all the information you need.

It’s 2024, and our attention spans are getting shorter.

Personally, I find it tough to read long documents or sit through hour-long videos. ⏳

That’s why I’ve decided to use drawings, emojis, and the simplest examples possible in my lessons.

My goal is to make learning Java as quick and painless as possible for everyone. 🙌

## But why Java? 😭

Although Java gets a lot of hate...

it is used by companies in tech, government, finance, healthcare, insurance, education, manufacturing, defense and more. 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Java for their backend architecture.
