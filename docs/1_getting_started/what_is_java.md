# 01) What is Java?

Java is a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language)

It is most commonly used for:

- Enterprise Applications
- Web Development
- Mobile Development (Android)

## Why Use Java?

- It is one of the most popular programming languages in the world
- It has a large demand in the current job market
- It is easy to learn and simple to use
- As Java is close to C++ and C#, it makes it easy for programmers to switch to Java or vice versa

## Strongly typed? Statically typed? 

Java is a strongly typed language, meaning that each variable must be declared with a specific [data type](/docs/basics/data_types), and type checking is enforced at [compile-time](/docs/getting_started/jdk_jre_jvm#compile).

Java:
```java
int number = 50;
number = "Fifty";
```
Python:
```python
number = 50
number = "Fifty"
```
